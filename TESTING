In order to run tests, the following contains important pre-requisites.

0. Cliffs notes to nosetests on the cmd line:

a. Run them all from the project root in an activated virtual environment.
b. Use the -sv options so you can see the test status.
c. Run the command with the path to the test method, test class, or test file.
d. Samples:

# Test Class
$ nosetests -sv sample.tests:AutoFileHashTest

# Test File
$ nosetests -sv engines.clamav.test.testscan

# to test an individual test:
$ nosetests -sv engines.avast.test.testscan:TestAvastAV.test_update


1. For Django tests (i.e. sample/tests.py):

a. When running nose tests on Django code, set the Environment Variable before running the test:

$ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=scaggr.settings

b. Ensure the database is created and populated with Django tables. (See INSTALL)


2. For A/V engine tests

a. Clamav test expects clamd to be running on the same host. (See INSTALL)
