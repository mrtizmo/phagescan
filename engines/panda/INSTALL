This guide was developed against Panda Antivirus Command Line
Scanner 9.5.1.2 on Windows XP SP3.

0. Get username and password

The Command Line Scanner (pavcl) is free to use. However to download
updated signatures, you need a username and password for the Panda
manual update server. To get that, you have to purchase a license
for ANY Panda A/V product (excluding Cloud versions) and then request
credentials for the manual update server.

We purchased Panda AntVirus Pro 2014.

Once you've purchase a license, contact Panda A/V tech support to request
a username and password for their virus signature updates site:

If you have trouble using your username and password, contact Panda
tech support. They are very prompt and will get it working.
