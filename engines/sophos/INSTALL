5. Update definitions.

Go to http://www.sophos.com/downloads/ide/

Download the compressed IDEs file for your version of Sophos Anti-Virus.
484 is Engine version 4.84.  

$ cd /tmp
$ wget http://downloads.sophos.com/downloads/ide/[version]_ides.zip

Extract the IDEs to the directory /usr/local/sav.
$ cd /usr/local/sav
$ sudo unzip /tmp/[version]_ides.zip

NOTE: Sophos releases a new version of their scan engine every month.
The installer contains the IDE files available at the time that the
scan engine was built.

The website hosts the latest IDEs for the last 3 months of scan engines.
Before installing the IDE files for a new version, you have to delete
the IDE files for the previous version.

----

7. (Optional)  Verify installation.

You scan files with the following command:
$ sweep -ss [file]

This ss option tells SAV to only output if a virus is found.

6a. Run against the EICAR test file:
$ cp [Project_root_dir]/generic/test/file/eicar.com.txt /tmp/eicar
$ sweep -ss /tmp/eicar

You should see a notification that the file is "infected".

6b. Run against the blat.ex_ test file:
$ cp [Project_root_dir]/generic/test/file/blat.ex_ /tmp/blat.ex_
$ sweep -ss /tmp/blat.ex_

You should not see a notification that the file is infected.
