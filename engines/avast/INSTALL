1. Install necessary OS packages.

If running Ubuntu:
$ sudo apt-get install $(< [this_directory]/PACKAGES.ubuntu)

If running CentOS:
TODO

----

2. Acquire libavastengine.

Installation files are available here: 
http://www.avast.com/download-software#tab2

Select the avast! for Linux/Unix server most appropriate for your environment.  

NOTE: Avast for linux is no longer available for download. It has reached 
end-of-life. Current users, like us, can continue using the version we have as 
well as downloading A/V dat updates.

----

3. Install libavastengine.

$ sudo dpkg -i libavastengine-4.7.6-i586.deb

NOTE: This step will attempt to fetch the latest virus definitions from avast! 
and will install a cron job to check for updates on a daily basis.  We will 
remove this cron job in the next step as a deployed avast! node is assumed to 
be lacking an Internet connection.  This auto-update (not the cron job) might 
have been useful if it actually worked. Unfortunately it does not, so we will 
run a manual update anyway.

Remove the auto-update cron job:
$ sudo crontab -e
Comment out the line that calls avast!'s update script.

----

4. Install avast! license.

$ sudo cp License.dat /var/lib/avast4/License.dat

NOTE: The way we are currently using Avast does not check for a license, so you 
can skip this step if you need to do development/testing and do not have access 
to the valid license.

----

5. Update definitions.

$ sudo avastvpsupdate.sh

----

6. Increase your kernel's SHMMAX variable.  

SHMMAX is the maximum size of shared memory allowed.  avast! requires a larger 
SHMMAX value than is typical for default settings.  If your SHMMAX is already 
larger than 128000000, then skip to the next step.

You can check your current SHMMAX thusly:
$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax

6a. Set the running SHMMAX to a higher value:
$ sudo sysctl -w kernel.shmmax=128000000

6b. Persist this higher value:
$ sudo su
$ echo "kernel.shmmax=128000000" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
$ exit

----

7. Extract avastcmd.

Acquire this file: avast4server-3.2.1-i586.tar.gz.

Extract a single binary from this archive to a location that PhageScan expects it:
$ tar -zxvf avast4server-3.2.1-i586.tar.gz avast4server-3.2.1-i586/bin/avastcmd
$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/avast/bin
$ sudo mv avast4server-3.2.1-i586/bin/avastcmd /opt/avast/bin
$ rm -rf ./avast4server-3.2.1-i586

----

8. (Optional) Verify correct installation by scanning the EICAR test file and blat.ex_.

7a. avast! provides no convenient means to explicitly tell the scanner to take 
no action upon discovery of an "infected" file.  Since we don't want to delete 
or "repair" our EICAR file, we first copy our test files to a new location on 
the off chance that avast! decides to modify these files.
$ cp -r [Project_root_dir]/engines/generic/test/file /tmp/file

7b. Run avast! on copied files:
$ /opt/avast/bin/avastcmd /tmp/file

7c. Successful output should look like the following:
/tmp/file/eicar.com.txt	[infected by: EICAR Test-NOT virus!!!]
/tmp/file/blat.ex_	[OK]
/tmp/file/evil.pdf	[infected by: JS:Pdfka-gen [Expl]]
