0. The following instructions were tested on / assume:
- Ubuntu 12.04 AMD64
- BitDefender for UNICES 7.6.4
- this file is in the current working directory

----

1. Acquire Bitdefender Antivirus Scanner for Unices

An evaluation version is available here:
http://www.bitdefender.com/site/Downloads/browseEvaluationVersion/2

The licensed version is available here:
http://download.bitdefender.com/SMB/Workstation_Security_and_Management/BitDefender_Antivirus_Scanner_for_Unices/Unix/Current/EN_FR_BR_RO/Linux/

We only care about the "nogui" installation option.

Debian, Redhat and other packages are offered.

----

2. Install requisite packages

$ sudo apt-get install $(< ./PACKAGES.ubuntu)

----

DECISION:
As these instructions assume an Ubuntu environment, you should have downloaded a .deb.run file.
This file is simply a license-acceptance wrapper around a .deb file.  If you accept the license,
it would be easier to simply retain the packaged .deb, as the installation of the .deb can be
easily scripted.  If you would like to extract the .deb for easier subsequent installation, use
step B3, else continue to step A3 for .deb.run interactive instructions.

----

A3. Verify package integrity (optional) & Install BitDefender

$ sh BitDefender-Antivirus-Scanner-nogui-7.6-4.linux-gcc3x.i586.deb.run --check
$ sudo sh BitDefender-Antivirus-Scanner-nogui-7.6-4.linux-gcc3x.i586.deb.run

Continue at step 4.

----

B3. Extract the packaged .deb and install BitDefender

$ sh BitDefender-Antivirus-Scanner-nogui-7.6-4.linux-gcc3x.i586.deb.run --keep

After license acceptance, the script should generate a folder in the current working directory
with its extracted contents, including the .deb.  You may not install / script installation of
the .deb in the normal fashion.

$ sudo dpkg -i <extracted_location>/bitdefender-scanner_7.6-4_i386.deb

Continue at step 4.

----

4. Update BitDefender

$ sudo bdscan --update

----

5. Test BitDefender installation

5a. Test scan EICAR (should work even if BitDefender update was unsuccessful):
$ /usr/bin/bdscan [Project_root_dir]/engines/generic/test/file/eicar.com.txt

BitDefender's output should include:
eicar.com.txt  infected: EICAR-Test-File (not a virus)

5b. Test scan a benign file:
$ /usr/bin/bdscan [Project_root_dir]/engines/generic/test/file/blat.ex_

BitDefender's output should include:
blat.ex_  ok

5c. Test scan a malicious file (this tests whether the initial BitDefender update was successful):
$ /usr/bin/bdscan [Project_root_dir]/engines/generic/test/file/evil.pdf

If BitDefender's initial update was successful, the scan output should include:
evil.pdf  ok
evil.pdf=>(JAVASCRIPT)  ok
evil.pdf=>(NAME)  infected: Exploit.PDF-Name.Gen
evil.pdf=>(CODE 1)  infected: Backdoor.Shell.AC
