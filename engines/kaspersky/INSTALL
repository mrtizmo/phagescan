1. Install necessary OS packages.

If running Ubuntu:
$ sudo apt-get install $(< [this_directory]/PACKAGES.ubuntu)

If running CentOS:
TODO

----

2. Acquire Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Linux. 

It is available here:
http://www.kaspersky.com/downloads/productupdates/downloads-endpoint-security-linux

Select the package best fit for your distribution.

----

3. Acquire a license file.

If you are using a purchased license, ensure there is a copy of the file on this host.

If you require a trial (30-day) .key, keep reading, else skip to the next step.

Kasperky offers trial (30-day) .keys, but the process obtaining them is 
somewhat convoluted. Kaspersky does not offer trial .keys alongside Kaspersky 
Endpoint for Linux downloads.  Instead you must acquire a key by showing 
interest and filling out the form for Kaspersky Business Space Security:
http://usa.kaspersky.com/products-services/business/business-space-security#tab3

After filling out the form (a valid e-mail address does not appear to be 
required), you're brought to a page that offers several links, one of which is 
a trial .key.  Download it to a location you'll remember. It will usually be
named 'kaspersky.key', but the name does not matter.

----

4. (Possibly) Extract the archive.  

Depending on the download option selected, two .debs (or the equivalent) 
might be enclosed:
	kes4lwks_<version_number>_i386.deb
	klnagent_<version_number>_i386.deb

We only care about the first package.  The second package is used for 
installing the Kaspersky Network Agent.  The Agent is used to connect the 
endpoint to a Kaspersky Administration Kit and is not applicable to our 
purposes.

These packages might also be offered individually.

----

5. Install Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Linux.

If running Ubuntu:
$ sudo dpkg -i kes4lwks_*_i386.deb

This is not common, but if you are on a 64-bit installation and you 
encounter an error about architecture mismatch, force the install:

$ sudo dpkg -i --force-architecture kes4lwks_*_i386.deb

Forcing the architecture should work, as per the Kaspersky installation manual.

If running CentOS:
TODO

----

6. Update unattended installation settings file (post_install.conf).

This file is located in the current directory.
You only need to update one line in this file.
The line with the path to the kaspersky license file must be updated
to point to the actual license file (kaspersky.key). The actual name
of the file does not matter.

----

7. Set up Kaspersky.

Execute the Kaspersky setup script to begin the unattended installation:

$ sudo /opt/kaspersky/kes4lwks/bin/kes4lwks-setup.pl  \
     --auto-install=/path/to/post_install.conf

When that finishes, skip to the next step.

If you have problems with the unattended installation, you can do an interactive
installation by doing the following:

$ sudo /opt/kaspersky/kes4lwks/bin/kes4lwks-setup.pl

- accept the EULA: YES (or stop here)
- specify locale: DEFAULT
- enter the path to your .key file that you acquired in step #2: VARIES
- configure proxy settings: VARIES
- download the latest databases: YES
- configure scheduled updates: NO
- kernel-level real-time protection module: NO (unnecessary for our purposes)
    - would you like to disable real-time protection? YES

If Kaspersky detects a SAMBA server:
- enable protection on the SAMBA server: NO (unnecessary for our purposes)
- specify path to smbd: CANCEL

- Would you like to load kes4lwks-qtgui at desktop startup by default? NO

If you need to replace your Kaspersky license (e.g. move from trial to 
commercial), issue the following:
$ /opt/kaspersky/kes4lwks/bin/kes4lwks-control --revoke-active-key
$ /opt/kaspersky/kes4lwks/bin/kes4lwks-control --install-active-key <path_to_your_new_key_file>
$ /opt/kaspersky/kes4lwks/bin/kes4lwks-control --query-status

----

8. Fix permissions.

Mark the Kaspersky control binary as setuid root (0).  This is necessary 
until a more fine-grained permissions approach is developed.  This binary 
should already be owned by root.
$ sudo chmod +s /opt/kaspersky/kes4lwks/bin/kes4lwks-control

----

9. Disable real-time protection.

Despite having chosen to disable real-time protection, the setup script will
say that it started the real-time protection service.  Just in case something 
is running and attempting real-time protection (it should fail without
the requisite kernel modules), we'll explicitly stop it:
$ /opt/kaspersky/kes4lwks/bin/kes4lwks-control --stop-task 8

NOTE: Real-time protection is always task 8, or is at least stable enough to be 
mentioned explictly in the manual.

----

10. Update definitions.

$ /opt/kaspersky/kes4lwks/bin/kes4lwks-control --set-settings Update -N \
	CommonSettings.SourceType=KLServers
$ /opt/kaspersky/kes4lwks/bin/kes4lwks-control --start-task Update -N -F /tmp/kes4lwks-update.log
$ /opt/kaspersky/kes4lwks/bin/kes4lwks-control --progress Update -N


Verify updates:
$ /opt/kaspersky/kes4lwks/bin/kes4lwks-control --get-stat Update

----

11. Verify installation.

11a. Create an On-Demand Scan (ODS):
$ /opt/kaspersky/kes4lwks/bin/kes4lwks-control --create-task test_task \
	--use-task-type=ODS

'test_task' is an abritrarily chosen name.  We will use it in the next several 
commands.

11b. Add the directory containing the test files to the ODS and tell Kaspersky 
that we don't want to quantine or otherwise remove "infected" files:

$ /opt/kaspersky/kes4lwks/bin/kes4lwks-control --set-settings test_task -N \
    ScanScope.AreaPath.Path=[Project_root_dir]/engines/generic/test/file/ \
    ScanScope.ScanSettings.InfectedFirstAction=skip

11c. Start the ODS:
$ /opt/kaspersky/kes4lwks/bin/kes4lwks-control --start-task test_task -N -W

11d. Read the output printed to the console.  The EICAR file should be found to 
be Virware, evil.pdf should be Trojware, and blat.ex_ should be called Riskware.

11e. Delete the task.
$ /opt/kaspersky/kes4lwks/bin/kes4lwks-control --delete-task test_task -N

----

12. Install a new key

When it comes time to renew the license, you'll have to install a new key file.
The key file comes in a .zip from the vendor and has a name like 24958C4D.key.

$ /opt/kaspersky/kes4lwks/bin/kes4lwks-control --install-active-key /path/to/new/file.key
