## Licenses in local file system ##
This directory stores all of the licenses for the software that is installed by Salt.

The directory structure should be:

licenses/<salt state  name>/<engine license file>

As an example, the license that goes with salt states in salt/avira/ would be:

licenses/avira/hbedv.key

## Licenses in GIT repository ##
As an alternative, you can keep licenses in a GIT repository. To do that, create a repository
 that uses SSH shared key for access. Name the repository anything you want, we'll call it 'my-lic'
 for this example. In the repository, you should have a 'master' branch containing your licenses.
 It should use the following directory structure pattern:

my-lic/<salt state name>/<engine license file>

As an example, the license that goes with salt states in salt/avira/ would be:

my-lic/avira/hbedv.key

Then, in salt-production/master, add your repo to the 'gitfs_remotes' section. Assuming we
are also using GIT to store our salt states in a repo named 'salt-states', your gitfs_remotes
would look like this:

gitfs_remotes:
  - git+ssh://git@github.com/myuser/salt-states.git
  - git+ssh://git@github.com/myuser/my-lic.git

The user running the salt master must have an ssh key connected with the repository.

Lastly, install the python module GitPython >= 0.3.0 and after you restart the salt-master,
the gitfs remote file sources will be active. (they are cached locally, but checked each time
a salt command is run)

This directory stores all of the local installation media that is installed by Salt.

The directory structure should be:

install-media/<salt state  name>/<engine files>

As an example, the media that goes with the states in salt/avira/ would be:

install-media/avira/antivir-server-prof.tar.gz
