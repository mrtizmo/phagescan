The following instructions will walk you through the steps to configure worker vms
to communicate with phagedev (master). No changes are required to phagedev. All changes
are applied the worker.

Note: Steps 0-4 are done automatically if you are using the multi-vm Vagrantfile.

0. Create vagrant worker VM.

$ vagrant up <workername>


1. Shutdown worker VM.

$ vagrant halt <workername>


2. Add a second network adapter to the VM.

This assumes that you are using VirtualBox. If you are using another 
Virtual Machine management tool, perform the same functionality.

Edit the config for the new VM using the VirtualBox Manager.
- Select the VM.
- Select the Settings icon.

Add and enable a second network adapter.
- Select the Network settings
- Select Adapter 2
- Check the box to Enable Nework Adapter
- Attached to: Host-only
- Adapter Name: vboxnet0
- Click OK to close and save your new settings.


3. Start the worker VM.

$ vagrant up <workername>


4. Assign a static IP to the second interface.

You will see one interface has a 10.x IP, leave that one alone.

Manually configure the second interface with the following values:

IP: 192.168.33.2x  (pick an x value so it is unique amongst your VMs)
GW: 192.168.33.1


5. Add a hosts entry for the scanmaster (phagedev vm)

192.168.33.10  scanmaster


6. Now your worker VM is ready to communicate with phagedev.
