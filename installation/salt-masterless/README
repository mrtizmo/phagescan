You need to create 3 directories to enable the salt states to function in a masterless
environment (not production).

To do it automatically, see PROJECT_ROOT/dev/vagrant_prep.py

To do it manually, do the following:
1. installation/salt-masterless/pillar
Copy pillar-sample as a template. Update settings.sls and top.sls files with your values.

2. installation/install-media/{scan_task_master, scan_worker}
Create the directory installation/install-media. In there you should place your installation
media in separate sub-directories. Most importantly, you MUST create the two sub-directories
'scan_task_master' and 'scan_worker'.
Run installation/scanmaster/make_scanmaster_zip.sh and place the .zip into 'scan_task_master'.
Run installation/scanworker/make_scanworker_zip.sh and place the .zip into 'scan_worker'.

3. installation/licenses
In there you should place your commercial licenses in separate sub-directories.

Note: For the install-media and licenses directories, the sub-directories should be named
similarly to the names of the salt states that are using those files. Refer to the salt
states that you intend to use for the proper naming of your license and install-media
sub-directories and files.

i.e.
salt states in
installation/salt-masterless/salt/avast/

would have install-media and licenses in:
installation/install-media/avast/
installation/licenses/avast/
