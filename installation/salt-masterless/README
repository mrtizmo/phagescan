In this directory you need to create 3 directories to enable the salt
states to function.

1. A directory named "pillar", use pillar-sample as a template.
Update settings.sls and top.sls file with your values.

2. A directory named "install-media". In there you should place
your installation media in separate subdirectories.

3. A directory named "licenses". In there you should place
your commercial licenses in separate subdirectories.

For the install-media and licenses directories, the subdirectories should
be named to match the names of the salt states that are using those files.
i.e. salt states in salt/avast/ would use install-media/avast/ and licenses/avast/

Refer to the salt states that you intend to use for the proper naming of your license
and install-media files.
