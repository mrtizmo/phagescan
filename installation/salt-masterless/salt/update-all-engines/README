The purpose of this state is to use a single salt command to easily call
the update state for all engines on a scanworker. Run the following command
on the salt master:

sudo salt '*worker*' state.sls update-all-engines

For this to work, each engine should have an update.sls file with a set of
states that executes that engine's definition update function ONLY when
the engine is installed.
