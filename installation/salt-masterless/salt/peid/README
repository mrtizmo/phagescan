These salt states will install the libraries to enable the Peid
tool to run on an Ubuntu Linux host.
These instructions assume that your vm was built using vagrant with the
salt-vagrant provisioner.


You can implement these salt states by running the following command
from within the vm:

$ sudo salt-call state.sls peid

There output should end with "local:" colored green.
