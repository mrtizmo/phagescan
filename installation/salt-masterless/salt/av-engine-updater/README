These salt states will install the av_sig_update.sh script into /root on
a Linux host. They will NOT execute the script to update the A/V
signatures. You should run it manually.
These instructions assume that your vm was built using vagrant with the
salt-vagrant provisioner.


Most of the A/V engines are straight forward with respect to upgrading signatures.
However, updating the Sophos engine requires some manual attention. Sophos releases a 
new version of their engine regularly. For this script, you need to ensure 
that the SOPHOS_IDES_FILE variable contains the correct update filename; 
the one that goes with the installed engine version.

So, if the installed engine is 4.87, then you'll use the update file 
named 487_ides.zip.

Note: The sophos.init states will set the ides file to the version defined in pillar.

Finally, you can implement these salt states by running the following command
from within the vm:

$ sudo salt-call state.sls av-engine-updater
