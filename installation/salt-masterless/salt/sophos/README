These salt states will install and configure the Sophos engine and libraries on
an Ubuntu Linux host. They will also update the A/V signatures to the latest version.
These instructions assume that your vm was built using vagrant with the
salt-vagrant provisioner.

Before running these salt states, you need to do the following:

Place install media into installation/install-media/sophos/
 The Sophos engine package: linux.amd64.glibc.2.3.tar.Z

 The Sophos package you have to download from the Sophos website.

 The file has to be named exactly as written in the pillar file pillar/settings.sls. 
 If you wish to use a different version, then you should update the associated 
 pillar variables in pillar/settings.sls.

Update the Sophos version number in the sophos_sig_pkg varible in pillar/settings.sls
If the sophos engine version is 4.89, enter 489 as the version number.

sophos_sig_pkg: 489_ides.zip


Finally, you can implement these salt states by running the following command
from within the vm:

$ sudo salt-call state.sls sophos

If all of the output from each state is colored teal, then all states were
successful. If any of the output from a state is colored red, then you have
a problem to resolve.
