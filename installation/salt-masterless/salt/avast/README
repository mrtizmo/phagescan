These salt states will install and configure the Avast engine and libraries on
an Ubuntu Linux host. They will also update the A/V signatures to the latest version.
These instructions assume that your vm was built using vagrant with the
salt-vagrant provisioner.


Before running these salt states, you need to do the following:

Place install media into installation/install-media/avast/
The Avast engine libraries: libavastengine-4.7.6-i586.deb
The Avast server package: avast4server-3.2.1-i586.tar.gz

Place license into installation/licenses/avast/
Your Avast license file: License.dat   

The Avast package/library you have to download from the Avast website. The license file
you should have received as an email attachment when you bought your Avast license.

The files have to be named exactly as written in the pillar file pillar/settings.sls. 
If you wish to use a different version, then you should update the associated 
pillar variables in pillar/settings.sls.


Finally, you can implement these salt states by running the following command
from within the vm:

$ sudo salt-call state.sls avast

If all of the output from each state is colored teal, then all states were
successful. If any of the output from a state is colored red, then you have
a problem to resolve.
