These salt states will install the libraries to enable the OPAF
tool to run on an Ubuntu Linux host. 
These instructions assume that your vm was built using vagrant with the
salt-vagrant provisioner.


You can implement these salt states by running the following command
from within the vm:

$ sudo salt-call state.sls opaf

If all of the output from each state is colored teal, then all states were
successful. If any of the output from a state is colored red, then you have
a problem to resolve.
