These salt states will install and configure the Kaspersky engine and libraries on
an Ubuntu Linux host. They will also update the A/V signatures to the latest version.
These instructions assume that your vm was built using vagrant with the
salt-vagrant provisioner.


Before running these salt states, you need to do the following:

1. Place install media into installation/install-media/kaspersky/

The Kaspersky engine package: kes4lwks_8.0.1-50_i386.deb

2. Place license into installation/licenses/kasperpsky/

Your Kaspersky license file: kaspersky.key

The Kaspersky package you have to download from the Kaspersky website. The license file
you should have received as an email attachment when you bought your Kaspersky license.

The files have to be named exactly as written in the pillar file pillar/settings.sls. 
If you wish to use a different version, then you should update the associated 
pillar variables in pillar/settings.sls.


Finally, you can implement these salt states by running the following command
from within the vm:

$ sudo salt-call state.sls kaspersky

If all of the output from each state is colored teal, then all states were
successful. If any of the output from a state is colored red, then you have
a problem to resolve.

Note: The last salt state will perform a signature update. This will take
several minutes, so be patient.
