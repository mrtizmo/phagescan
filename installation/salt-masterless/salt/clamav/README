These salt states will install and configure the ClamAV engine and libraries on
an Ubuntu Linux host. They will also update the A/V signatures to the latest version.
These instructions assume that your vm was built using vagrant with the
salt-vagrant provisioner.


You can implement these salt states by running the following command
from within the vm:

$ sudo salt-call state.sls clamav

If all of the output from each state is colored teal, then all states were
successful. If any of the output from a state is colored red, then you have
a problem to resolve.
