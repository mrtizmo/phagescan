These salt states will install and configure the Bitdefender engine and libraries on
an Ubuntu Linux host. They will also update the A/V signatures to the latest version.
These instructions assume that your vm was built using vagrant with the
salt-vagrant provisioner.


Before running these salt states, you need to do the following:

----

1. Place install media into installation/install-media/bitdefender/
The BitDefender engine: bitdefender-scanner_7.6-4_i386.deb

This engine .deb can be attained by running the .deb.run downloaded from
BitDefender's website with the --keep flag.

This file must be named exactly as written in the pillar file pillar/settings.sls.
If you wish to use a different version, then you should update the associated
pillar variables in pillar/settings.sls.

----

2. Update pillar/settings.sls with your BitDefender license key.

Look for the following line in that file:
bitdefender_license: LICENSE

And replace "LICENSE" with your license key.

----

Finally, you can implement these salt states by running the following command
from within the vm:

$ sudo salt-call state.sls bitdefender

If all of the output from each state is colored teal, then all states were
successful. If any of the output from a state is colored red, then you have
a problem to resolve.
