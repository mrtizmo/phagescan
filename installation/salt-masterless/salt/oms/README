These salt states will install the libraries to enable the Office Malware Scan 
tool to run on an Ubuntu Linux host. 
These instructions assume that your vm was built using vagrant with the
salt-vagrant provisioner.

Before running these salt states, you need to do the following:

Add 1 file into this directory (salt/oms/):

The OfficeMalScanner package: OfficeMalScanner.zip

You can download the OfficeMalScanner package as described in the oms INSTALL
instructions.


You can implement these salt states by running the following command
from within the vm:

$ sudo salt-call state.sls oms

If all of the output from each state is colored teal, then all states were
successful. If any of the output from a state is colored red, then you have
a problem to resolve.

Note: This will take a long time to install. Wine is a finicky program to
install on an older OS. So, first we have to install all of the updated
system packages. Then we can install Wine. There are over 100 packages
that wine depends on, all of which have to be installed with wine.
