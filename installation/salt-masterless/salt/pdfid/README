PDFiD can run on any linux host containing current versions of python, with
no special modules. So, this salt state is a noop.
These instructions assume that your vm was built using vagrant with the
salt-vagrant provisioner.


You can implement these salt states by running the following command
from within the vm:

$ sudo salt-call state.sls pdfid

There output should end with "local:" colored green.
