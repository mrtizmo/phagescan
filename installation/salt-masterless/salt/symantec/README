These salt states will install and configure the Symantec engine and libraries on
a CentOS 6 Linux host. They will also update the A/V signatures to the latest version.
These instructions assume that your vm was built using vagrant with the
salt-vagrant provisioner.


Before running these salt states, you need to do the following:

1. Place install media into installation/install-media/symantec/

 The Symantec engine package: Symantec_Protection_Engine_NAS_7.0.1.1_Linux_IN.zip
 The Java JRE package: jre-7u10-linux-i586.rpm

2. Place license into installation/licenses/symantec/

 Your Symantec license file: spe.slf

 The Symantec engine package you have to download from the Symantec website. The license file
 you should have received as an email attachment when you bought your Symantec license.
 The java JRE, you can download from Sun.com (URL in engine/symantec/INSTALL.symantec-7.0)

 The files have to be named exactly as written in the pillar file pillar/settings.sls. 
 If you wish to use a different version, then you should update the associated 
 pillar variables in pillar/settings.sls.

Update the symantec admin password hash in pillar/settings.sls. See INSTALL.symantec-7.0
for guidance.

Update the username in the no_ask_questions.txt file, if you want a user other than vagrant.

Finally, you can implement these salt states by running the following command
from within the vm:

$ sudo salt-call state.sls symantec

If all of the output from each state is colored teal, then all states were
successful. If any of the output from a state is colored red, then you have
a problem to resolve.
