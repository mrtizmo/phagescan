These salt states will install and configure the Eset engine and libraries on
an Ubuntu Linux host. They will also update the A/V signatures to the latest version.
These instructions assume that your vm was built using vagrant with the
salt-vagrant provisioner.

Before running these salt states, you need to do the following:

1. Place install media into installation/install-media/eset/
The Eset package: esets-4.0.8.amd64.deb

2. Place license into installation/licenses/eset/
Your Eset license file: nod32.lic

The Eset package you have to download from the Eset website. The license file
you should have received as an email attachment when you bought your Eset license.

The files have to be named exactly as written in the pillar file pillar/settings.sls. 
If you wish to use a different version, then you should update the associated 
pillar variables in pillar/settings.sls.

2. Update pillar/settings.sls with your Eset update_username and update_password.
These values come from you Eset license documentation.

Look for the following lines in that file and replace the USER and PASS values with
your own:
eset_update_username: USER
eset_update_password: PASS


Finally, you can implement these salt states by running the following command
from within the vm:

$ sudo salt-call state.sls eset

If all of the output from each state is colored teal, then all states were
successful. If any of the output from a state is colored red, then you have
a problem to resolve.

Note: The last salt state will update the A/V signatures. This will take
several minutes, so be patient.
