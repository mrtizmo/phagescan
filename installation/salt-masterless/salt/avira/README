These salt states will install and configure the Avira engine and libraries on
an Ubuntu Linux host. They will also update the A/V signatures to the latest version.
These instructions assume that your vm was built using vagrant with the
salt-vagrant provisioner.


Before running these salt states, you need to do the following:

Place install media into installation/install-media/avira/
The Avira engine package: antivir-server-prof.tar.gz

Place license into installation/licenses/avira/
Your Avira license file: hbedv.key

The Avira package/library you have to download from the Avira website. The license file
you should have received as an email attachment when you bought your Avira license.

The files have to be named exactly as written in the pillar file pillar/settings.sls. 
If you wish to use a different version, then you should update the associated 
pillar variables in pillar/settings.sls.


Finally, you can implement these salt states by running the following command
from within the vm:

$ sudo salt-call state.sls avira

If all of the output from each state is colored teal, then all states were
successful. If any of the output from a state is colored red, then you have
a problem to resolve.

Note: The last step in the salt states is to update the signatures, which will
take several minutes. So, be patient.
