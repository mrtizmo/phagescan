Phagescan Admin Web User Interface
==================================

The Phagescan Admin web user interface is where the Admin can make manual adjustments to the Phagescan setup.

Accessing
=========

Access the Phagescan Admin Web User Interface on localhost by going to this URL::

    http://127.0.0.1:9000/admin

A production master will have a Nginx front-end, so you'll want to access via the public IP address that Nginx is listening on.
It may be on port 80 or 443 depending on SSl configuration::

    http://1.2.3.4/admin
    https://1.2.3.4/admin

Configuration
=============

There are only a couple of places where configuration is needed.

1. first place
2. second place
