This is the root INSTALL file. 
 If you are performing a manual build/install for either development or 
production, follow the instructions listed here first and continue onto 
the appropriate INSTALL.* file as directed at the bottom.

 If you are manually building a Windows scanworker, skip the remainder of
this file and go directly to:
[Project_root_dir]/installation/scanworker/INSTALL.WindowsXP

 If you are using vagrant and salt to automatically build/install/configure
your develompment VMs, skip the remainder of this file and go directly to:
[Project_root_dir]/installation/dev/INSTALL.vagrant-salt


Ubuntu instructions were tested on 12.04 x86_64, Desktop edition.
CentOS instructions were tested on 6.3 x86_64 and 6.4 x86_64.
Windows instructions were tested on Windows XP SP3.

----

0. Clone the git repo to your development host

$ git config --global user.name "yourUserName"
$ git config --global user.email you@domain.com
$ git clone git@github.com:scsich/phagescan.git
 
Select your git branch:

$ cd phagescan
$ git branch --all
$ git checkout -b <mybranch> origin/<mybranch>

The phagescan directory created by git will be referred to as
[Project_root_dir] throughout the documentation.

----

1. Install necessary OS packages.

If running Ubuntu:
$ sudo apt-get install $(< [Project_root_dir]/PACKAGES.ubuntu)

If running CentOS:

We only used CentOS as a scanworker. So, skip the rest of this document
and refer to the CentOS scanworker INSTALL instructions:
[Project_root_dir]/installation/scanworker/INSTALL.CentOS

----

2. Build & activate a virtual environment
$ virtualenv ~/psvirtualenv
$ source ~/psvirtualenv/bin/activate

Your prompt should look like this after:
(psvirtualenv)[user@host]$

If you need to deactivate the virtual env:
(don't do this now) $ deactivate

----

3. Continue on to the next INSTALL file as appropriate for the build you are 
creating.

If creating a development environment (scanmaster, scanworker, web server, 
IDE all on the same node):
[Project_root_dir]/installation/dev/INSTALL

If creating a production scanmaster node:
[Project_root_dir]/installation/scanmaster/INSTALL

If creating a production scanworker node:
[Project_root_dir]/installation/scanworker/INSTALL
